# Under Construction

Welcome to my Vault, a space where I can share cool gamedev related stuff.

The place is yet under construction but I hope to have it up and running by the end of te week. Here is what was done and what still needs to be done:

 - Create a static website development repository âœ”
   - I chose [Hugo](http://gohugo.io) for the simplicity it brings me.
 - Configure a website theme and fill my presentation information
 - Add cool content
